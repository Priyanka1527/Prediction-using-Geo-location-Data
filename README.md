# Prediction-using-Geo-location-Data
In this application, I'm trying to capture the user's ip address and return the geo location data including Latitude/Longitude. Afterwards, The application should provide the nearest Pharmacy store details based on the calculated distance between user's latitude/longitude and the already stored data in database.
